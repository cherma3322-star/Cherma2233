Sample Input 0

45
7
Sample Output 0

Addition=52
Subtraction=38
Multiplication=315
Division=6
Modulo=3

ANSWER:
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
import math
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
Addition = (a + b)
Subtraction = (a - b)
Multiplication = (a * b)
Division = (a / b)
Modulo = (a % b) 
print(f"Addition={Addition}")
print(f"Subtraction={Subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication={Multiplication}")
print(f"Division={math.floor(Division)}")
print(f"Modulo={Modulo}")
